This is a simple to use implementation of the 4E GURPS ruleset for use with Foundry VTT. It should be compatible with foundry version 0.7.5 and higher.  Bugs, feedback or suggestions are welcome. The goal here is to provide a quick to set up playable system not to automate the myriad modifiers and situational components of gurps.  Any and all modifiers should be calculated and called by the players or GM and applied during play.  Using the alt key when clicking a roll button will provide a simple dialog to imput the modifier befor rolling. No different than you would at a table with paper character sheets.

We provide no pre-made skills, traits or other components.  but you can build those from your gurps books!
